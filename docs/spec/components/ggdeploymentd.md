# `ggdeploymentd` spec

The GG-Lite deployment daemon (`ggdeploymentd`) is a service that is responsible
for receiving and processing deployments. It should be able to receive
deployments from multiple sources and maintain a queue of deployment tasks.

The deployment daemon will need to receive deployments (can be from a local
deployment, AWS IoT Shadow, or AWS IoT Jobs), placing them into a queue so that
one deployment can be processed at a time. Note that the order that deployments
are received is not guaranteed, for example a group deployment from AWS IoT Jobs
may arrive after another AWS IoT Jobs deployment while having an earlier
timestamp.

A (very) brief overview of the key steps that should be executed during a
deployment task processing:

- Deployment validation: includes verifying that the deployment is not stale,
  and checking that any kernel required capabilities are satisfied.
- Dependency resolution: Resolve the versions of components required by the
  deployment, including getting root components from all thing groups and
  negotiating component version with cloud. This step also gets component
  recipes for the correct component version.
- Download large configuration: If the deployment configuration is large (>7KB
  for Shadow or >31KB for Jobs), download the full large configuration from
  cloud. Ensure that docker is installed if any component specifies a docker
  artifact.
- Download artifacts: Download artifacts from customer S3, Greengrass service
  accounts S3, or docker. Check that artifacts do not exceed size constraints,
  set permissions, and unarchive if needed.
- Config resolution: Resolve the new configuration to be applied, including
  interpolation for placeholder variables.
- Merge configuration: If configured to do so, notify components that are
  subscribed via SubscribeToComponentUpdates. Wait if there are any
  DeferComponentUpdate responses requesting a delay. Merge the new configuration
  in.
- Track service states: Track the lifecycle states of components and report
  success when all components are RUNNING or FINISHED. Clean up stale versions
  at the end of the deployment process.

A deployment is considered cancellable anytime before the merge configuration
step begins merging the configuration. The GG-Lite implementation may choose to
change this to allow cancellation at any step (TBD).

It is possible for a deployment to require a bootstrap. This means that Nucleus
will need to restart during the deployment. In these deployments, the merge
configuration step will enter a different logic path that keeps track of the
Nucleus state and bootstrap steps.

## Requirements

Currently, cancelled deployments and bootstrap are considered out of scope of
the following requirements.

1. [ggdeploymentd-1] The deployment service is able to receive deployments to be
   handled.
   - [ggdeploymentd-1.1] The deployment service may receive local deployments
     over IPC CreateLocalDeployment.
   - [ggdeploymentd-1.2] The deployment service may receive local deployments on
     startup via a deployment doc file.
   - [ggdeploymentd-1.3] The deployment service may receive IoT jobs
     deployments.
   - [ggdeploymentd-1.4] Multiple deployments may be received and handled such
     that they do not conflict with each other.
2. [ggdeploymentd-2] The deployment service may handle a deployment that
   includes new root components.
   - [ggdeploymentd-2.1] The deployment service will resolve a dependency order
     and versions for components with dependencies.
   - [ggdeploymentd-2.2] The deployment service may prepare a component with a
     locally provided recipe.
   - [ggdeploymentd-2.3] The deployment service may prepare a component with a
     recipe from the cloud.
   - [ggdeploymentd-2.4] The deployment service may prepare a component with an
     artifact from a customer's S3 bucket.
   - [ggdeploymentd-2.5] The deployment service may prepare a component with an
     artifact from a Greengrass service account's S3 bucket.
   - [ggdeploymentd-2.6] The deployment service will run component install
     scripts in the component dependency order.
3. [ggdeploymentd-3] The deployment service fully supports configuration
   features.
   - [ggdeploymentd-3.1] The deployment service may handle a component's default
     configuration.
   - [ggdeploymentd-3.2] The deployment service may handle configuration updates
     and merge/reset configuration.
4. [ggdeploymentd-4] The deployment service is aware of device membership within
   multiple thing groups when executing a new deployment.
   - [ggdeploymentd-4.1] If the device has multiple deployments from different
     thing groups, it will use root components from other deployments during
     resolution.
   - [ggdeploymentd-4.2] Configuration changes from other thing groups is
     correctly handled.
   - [ggdeploymentd-4.3] Stale components are removed from the device on a new
     deployment handling.
5. [ggdeploymentd-5] The deployment service may notify components and get
   confirmation to move forward with the deployment.
   - [ggdeploymentd-5.1] Functionality on the core bus is exposed that handles
     SubscribeToComponentUpdates IPC commands from the IPC daemon, and the
     deployment service notifies components about updates if configured to do
     so.
   - [ggdeploymentd-5.2] Functionality on the core bus is exposed that handles
     DeferComponentUpdates IPC commands from the IPC daemon, and the deployment
     service defers a component update if notified.
   - [ggdeploymentd-5.3] Functionality on the core bus is exposed that handles
     SubscribeToValidateConfigurationUpdates IPC commands, and the deployment
     service notifies components about updates to the component configuration.
   - [ggdeploymentd-5.4] Functionality on the core bus is exposed that handles
     SendConfigurationValidityReport IPC commands, and the deployment fails if a
     component notifies that the configuration is not valid.
6. [ggdeploymentd-6] Other components may make a request on the core bus and IPC
   to get the status of a deployment.
7. [ggdeploymentd-7] Other components may make a request on the core bus and IPC
   to get the list of local deployments.

### Future-Looking Possibilities

These are not requirements, but are documented as possible items to be supported
in the future.

- The deployment service may receive AWS IoT Shadow deployments.
- The deployment service may prepare a component with docker artifacts.
- If the deployment configuration is above 7KB for Shadow deployments or 31KB
  for Jobs deployments, the deployment service will download the large
  configuration from the cloud.
- The deployment may be cancelled during certain phases of deployment handling.
