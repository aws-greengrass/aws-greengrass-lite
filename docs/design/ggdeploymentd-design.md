# GG-Lite `ggdeploymentd`: Initial Implementation Design

## Overview

The GG-Lite deployment daemon (`ggdeploymentd`) is a service that is responsible
for receiving and processing deployments. It should be able to receive
deployments from all possible sources and execute the deployment tasks from a
queue.

As an initial goal toward complete deployment implementation, a subset of
deployments is being considered for this document. The user story for this
functionality should be that a user can create a local deployment with a single
"Hello World" component.

## Requirements

Out of the larger scope of requirements set in the `ggdeploymentd` spec
document, the following are included in the initial implementation scope:

- [ggdeploymentd-1.1] The deployment service may receive local deployments over
  IPC CreateLocalDeployment.
- [ggdeploymentd-1.2] The deployment service may receive local deployments on
  startup via a deployment doc file.
- [ggdeploymentd-2.2] The deployment service may prepare a component with a
  locally provided recipe.

Note that this does not include a full set of component features, such as
component configuration or component artifacts.

## System Flow

Receiving Local Deployments:

1. On start, the `ggdeploymentd` daemon checks for any provided deployment doc
   files, forms them into deployment tasks, and adds these to the deployment
   queue.
2. The daemon receives CreateLocalDeployment IPC requests that includes the
   deployment doc.
3. CreateLocalDeployment requests are formed into a deployment task to add to
   the deployment queue. If it is an update to an existing deployment in queue,
   update that deployment instead.

Executing Deployments:

1. If the deployment queue is not empty, then take one deployment task from the
   queue to be executed.
2. Copy recipe from the specified recipe path to the Greengrass-managed packages
   folder.
3. Run component install scripts according to dependency order via recipe
   runner.
4. Register all the recipes with the system orchestrator that will start the
   components.
5. When component health status is good, notify FSS that the deployment is
   successful. Deployment logic is complete and starts again at step 1.
