# AWS Greengrass Lite

AWS IoT Greengrass runtime for constrained devices.

The Greengrass Lite nucleus provides a smaller alternative to the Classic
nucleus for Greengrass v2 deployments.

Greengrass Lite aims to maintain compatibility with the Classic nucleus, and
implements a subset of its functionality.

## Getting started

See the [build guide](docs/INSTALL.md) for instructions to build Greengrass Lite
from source.

To run Greengrass Lite for evaluation, see the [setup guide](docs/SETUP.md).

For setting up as a Greengrass developer, also see the
[developer setup guide](docs/DEVELOPMENT.md).
